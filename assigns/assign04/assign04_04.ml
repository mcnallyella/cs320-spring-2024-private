(* List Convolution and Multiplying Polynomials

   This problem has three parts:

   ====================

   1. Implement the function `map2` which, given

     f : 'a -> 'b -> 'c
     l : 'a list
     r : 'b list

   returns the result of applying `f` to each element of `l` and `r`
   pointwise.  If `l` and `r` are different lengths, then the longer
   list should be truncated to the length of the shorter list.

   For example, `map2 f [a;b] [c;d;e]` is equivalent to

     [f a c ; f b d]

   This is a two-list version of the function `List.map`.  You should
   not use the function `List.map2` in your implementation (the
   standard library version does not work the way we've defined `map2`
   here).

   ====================

   2. Implement the function `consecutives` which, given

     len : a positive integer
     l : a list

   returns the list of all consecutive sublists of `l` of length

     min len (List.length l)

   Example:
   let _ = assert (consecutives 2 [1;2;3;4;5] = [[1;2];[2;3];[3;4];[4;5]])
   let _ = assert (consecutives 1 [] = [[]])
   let _ = assert (consecutives 10 [1;2;3;4;5] = [[1;2;3;4;5]])

   Hint: Use the functions `map2` and `List.map`.

   ====================

   3. We can use `List.map` and `consecutives` to implement a process
   called LIST CONVOLUTION, which can be used to implement polynomial
   multiplication.

   See the definition `list_conv` below.  Take some time to try to
   understand it.  In essence, the list `l` is "lined up" with `r` in
   all possible ways and a function is applied `l` and the sublist of
   `r` it is lined up with.  For example

     list_conv f [1;2] [3;4;5;6]

   is equivalent to

     [ f [1;2] [3;4] ; f [1;2] [4;5] ; f [1;2] [5;6] ]

   A polynomial is represented as a `int list` where the i-th element
   is the coefficient of x^i.  For example,

     p(x) = 1 + 2x + 5x^2 + 4x^4

   is represented by

     [1;2;5;0;4]

   The function for multiplying polynomials is filled in below for you
   using list convolution.  Your task is to determine what function
   `poly_mult_helper` to convolve with.  Take some time to try to
   understand the local let-definitions in `poly_mult`.

   Example:
   let _ = assert (poly_mult [1;2;3] [4;5] = [4;13;22;15])
   let _ = assert (poly_mult [4;5] [1;2;3] = [4;13;22;15])
   (* ( 1 + 2x + 3x^2 ) ( 4 + 5x ) = 4 + 13x + 22x^2 + 15x^3 *)
*)

let rec map2 (f : 'a -> 'b -> 'c) (l : 'a list) (r : 'b list) : 'c list =
  (* creates a pointwise combined list *)
  match l, r with
  | [], _ -> []
  | _, [] -> []  
  | hd1::tl1, hd2::tl2 -> (f hd1 hd2) :: map2 f tl1 tl2  

let consecutives (len : int) (l : 'a list) : 'a list list =
  (* creates sublist of len n *)
  let rec make_sub_list n x new_list =
    if n <= 0 then List.rev new_list
    else 
      (match x with
      | [] -> List.rev new_list
      | hd::tl -> make_sub_list (n-1) tl (hd::new_list))
  in
  (* loops through each element in list and calls make_sub_list *)
  let rec loop_list list new_list =
    match list with
    | [] -> List.rev new_list
    | hd::tl -> 
      if (List.length list) < len then new_list
      else loop_list tl ((make_sub_list len list [])::new_list)
  in
  if (List.length l) <= len then [l]
  else loop_list l []


let list_conv
    (f : 'a list -> 'b list -> 'c)
    (l : 'a list)
    (r : 'b list) : 'c list =
  List.map (f l) (consecutives (List.length l) r)

let poly_mult_helper (u : int list) (v : int list) : int =
  let rec dot_product a b =
    match a,b with 
    | [], []-> 0
    | h1::t1, h2::t2 -> (h1 * h2) + dot_product t1 t2
    | _, _ -> failwith "Dot product, wrong sizes"
  in 
  dot_product u (List.rev v)

let poly_mult (p : int list) (q : int list) : int list =
  let padding = List.init (List.length p - 1) (fun _ -> 0) in
  let padded_q = padding @ q @ padding in
  List.rev (list_conv poly_mult_helper p padded_q)
